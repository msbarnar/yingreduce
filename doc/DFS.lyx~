\begin_layout Title
Distributed File System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Section
Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Distributed File System (DFS) is a key->value database distributed pseudoran
domly among a computer network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic unit of storage, transmission, and accession in the system is
 the 
\emph on
page, 
\emph default
and multiple pages are related by a 
\emph on
table name
\emph default
.
 A page is an array of 
\emph on
elements
\emph default
 composed of a 
\emph on
key 
\emph default
and a 
\emph on
value
\emph default
.
 The key and value are serializable types known as 
\emph on
writable
\emph default
.
 The key is further defined as being 
\emph on
comparable
\emph default
 to other keys, so that a set of keys can be sorted naturally.
 The internal composition and structure of the keys and values is not defined,
 as long as they implement the writable interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For data to be entered into the system it must be translated from an arbitrary
 format to a set of 
\emph on
elements
\emph default
.
 This is accomplished by implementing an 
\emph on
element reader
\emph default
, which reads elements from an arbitrary source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One node in the DFS may be provided with an element reader and will proceed
 to draw elements from it until the source is depleted or it is stopped.
 As elements are read from the source they are placed in a 
\emph on
page builder
\emph default
, which serializes them and assembles them in sequentially numbered pages
 of limited capacity.
 When a page's capacity is reached such that the next element would exceed
 its capacity, the page is 
\emph on
closed
\emph default
 and placed in a queue for distribution; simultaneously a new page is created
 and the page builder continues to accept elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As pages arrive in the 
\emph on
distribution queue, 
\emph default
their destination is determined by hashing their table name concatenated
 with their integral index.
